This is Juliet and Kate's Rideshare Project that aims to simulate a ridesharing experience (similar to uber). 
It generates 31 stations that are later populated with 20 cars and 50 passengers in scenario 1 and then 10 
cars and 30 passengers in scenario 2. To test which scenario yielded the highest average revenue, we ran the 
simulation 10 times then calculated the average (total sum of revenue รท 10). 

scenario 1 average revenue:
trial 1: 
trial 2:
trial 3:
trial 4:
trial 5:
trial 6:
trial 7:
trial 8: 
trial 9: 
trial 10:

scenario 2 average revenue:
trial 1: 43.0
trial 2: 46.0
trial 3: 32.0
trial 4: 36.0
trial 5: 46.0
trial 6: 32.0
trial 7: 29.0
trial 8: 42.0
trial 9: 31.0
trial 10: 44.0
